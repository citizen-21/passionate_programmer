The Paper House - 

We replaced existing manual Xerox related work with a web-based system changing the way of fulfilling 
the people needs which will also prove to be beneficial, improve efficiency and save time.
This web-based platform contains users like customers, xerox shop owners and admin.
Multiple xerox shop owners can register themselves on this platform and provide services accordingly.

Using this platform customers can select any of the given services (xerox, printing, binding, lamination, scanning, rubber stamps, badge making etc) 
provided by the xerox shop owner in an easy and proper format. 

Customers can make a request by selecting the above-mentioned services and can also pay through online payment methods. 
Also, customers will get notified aware of their work progress. 
Once the work is completed they can simply come and collect the documents from the xerox shop or they can choose a home delivery option as per their need. 
They can also provide feedback about their work whether they are satisfied or not.
